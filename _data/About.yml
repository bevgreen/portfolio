  - title: Hi, I’m Beverly Green (she/her) — a dairy cow herd manager turned full stack software developer. I’ve always had a deep love for animals and a curiosity about how the world works, which led me to earn a Bachelor's degree and spend five years in the veterinary field.
          While I valued the hands-on care I provided, I found myself searching for a more sustainable career that still challenged me intellectually. Around that time, my brother introduced me to programming, and I quickly became hooked. What started as curiosity grew into a passion for solving problems, building creative solutions, and turning ideas into real, usable products.
          In December 2024, I enrolled in an intensive full-time, remote Full Stack Software Engineering program. Over the next five months, I committed 60 hours a week to learning object-oriented programming, modern technologies, and collaborating with peers across the country on real-world applications. I thrived in an environment that demanded both technical skill and strong communication.
          As I take this next step in my career, I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to a team, continue building useful tools, and grow as a developer. I’m especially excited by opportunities that blend creativity, problem-solving, and meaningful impact.
